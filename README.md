## Skills

#### Communication

In my previous roles, I have consistently demonstrated excellent communication skills, both in conversation and writing. For example, during group projects at Makers Academy, particularly the Reliability Project. We were approached by a client, HOSP, tasked with improving the reliability of their servers. I actively engaged and led team discussions, ensuring that all team members' ideas for enhancing server performance were carefully considered. I prioritised clear communication by sharing all resources, research findings, inspired ideas, or test results with the team ensuring the entire team had an unvarying, consistent level of understanding, which enabled us to progress more efficiently. As the project neared completion, we were responsible for delivering a presentation. We rehearsed multiple times, and after each session, I offered constructive feedback to help refine and perfect our final delivery. My ability to produce high-quality written work, sharpened through studying English Literature, allowed me to critically analyse and articulate key insights with clarity and precision. Remaining open to feedback throughout, I embraced constructive criticism as a tool for personal and collective growth. These communication skills played a crucial role in our team achieving 100% reliability on the dashboard that tracked server performance, directly contributing to the overall success of the project.

#### Fast Learner

In addition to my technical experience, I am proud of my ability to learn new technologies quickly and effectively. For example, during my final year at university, I was part of a small team tasked with developing a game for PJ Care using the Unity game engine. Although I had no prior experience with C#, I was determined to contribute technically to the project. I took the initiative to learn the language independently by following YouTube tutorials and completing the Codecademy C# course. This self-directed learning enabled me to write object-oriented C# code, and I played a key role in creating a 2D memory snap game equipped with animations, custom menu screens, and working in-game score displays. The project required regular testing and updates based on client feedback, which further honed my C# skills and allowed me to produce high-quality, clean code. The project earned a first-class mark, an achievement Iâ€™m proud to have contributed to from a technical and creative standpoint.
